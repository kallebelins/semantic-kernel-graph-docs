```csharp
// High-performance configuration
var performanceGraph = new Graph
{
    StartNode = startNode,
    Nodes = new[] { startNode, parallelNode1, parallelNode2, endNode },
    Options = new GraphOptions
    {
        EnableParallelExecution = true,
        MaxConcurrency = 10,
        EnableDistributedExecution = true
    }
};
```

Perfect for:
* 🚀 High-traffic applications
* 📊 Big data processing
* 🏢 Enterprise workloads
* 🌐 Global scale deployments
