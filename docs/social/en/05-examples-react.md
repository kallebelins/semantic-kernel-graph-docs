# 🤔 ReAct Pattern: When Your AI Needs to Think Before Acting

Ever wondered how to make your AI applications more intelligent? The **ReAct pattern** (Reasoning + Acting) is the answer!

**Semantic Kernel Graph** makes implementing ReAct simple:

🧠 **Reasoning Node** - AI analyzes the situation
🎯 **Action Node** - AI executes the best action
🔄 **Feedback Loop** - AI learns from results
📊 **State Management** - Tracks reasoning process

```csharp
// ReAct becomes a simple graph
var reactGraph = new Graph
{
    StartNode = reasoningNode,
    Nodes = new[] { reasoningNode, actionNode, feedbackNode }
};
```

Perfect for:
- 🔍 Problem-solving applications
- 🎯 Decision-making systems
- 🧪 Research and analysis tools
