Graphs + AI in .NET: Why is this a game-changer?

.NET developers and architects, let's take your AI orchestration to the next level. I've created 60+ practical examples in C# and comprehensive documentation (100+ pages including guides, tutorials, and APIs) to help you go from zero to advanced in execution graphs with LLMs.

What's unique about a graph system (and why does it matter)?

- GraphVisualization: Visualize nodes, edges, and state in real time to understand and debug complex flows.
- GraphExecutor: Dependency-driven execution, safe parallelism, and deterministic scheduling.
- ConditionalNode/ConditionalEdge: Dynamic routing with guardrails and local decisions per node.
- DynamicRouting: Path selection based on context/LLM, without giant if statements scattered throughout the code. - LoopNodes: Feedback loops and controlled iterations, essential for agents and refinements.
- SimpleForkJoin: Painless parallelism with explicit synchronization (fan-out/fan-in).
- SubgraphExamples: Composition and reuse of subgraphs as building blocks for larger architectures.
- Checkpointing (Concepts/Quickstart): State persistence and resilient resumption after failures.
- State & Serialization: Typed state, serialization, and context passing between nodes safely.
- Schema Typing & Validation: Strict per-node contracts, input/output validation, and pipeline trust.
- Metrics & Logging: Per-node metrics, edge tracing, and end-to-end observability.
- HumanInTheLoop: Human intervention at critical points in the graph, with approval/editing of results.
- ErrorPolicies: Retry/fallback policies localized per node/edge (not the entire process).
- Optimizers & Few-Shot: Path and cost optimization guided by metrics and examples.
- React/CoT Agents: Graph-structured agents for step-by-step reasoning with LLM.
- Multi-Agent & Retrieval (RAG Multi-Hop): Agent coordination and retrieval chains across multiple hops.
- Resource Governance: Per-node limits and budgets, controlling token consumption and external calls.
- REST Tools/Plugin System: Tools and integrations as graph nodes, handled declaratively.
- Security & Data: Data isolation and per-node policies in sensitive pipelines.
- Streaming: Partial token-by-token responses across the graph, with stateful control.

Why do graphs power AI?

- Composability: Combine LLMs, tools, memory, and humans as reusable nodes.
- Reliability: Each edge is a contract; each node has clear error, cost, and metric policies.
- Scalability: native parallelism, reusable subgraphs, and checkpointing for real workloads.

If you want to move beyond the PoC and into production with AI, graphs are the way to go.
