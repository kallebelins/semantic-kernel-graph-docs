# 🧠 Computational Graphs: The Secret Sauce Behind Modern AI Workflows

Think of AI workflows as a recipe. But what if your recipe could make decisions, adapt on the fly, and learn from experience?

**Semantic Kernel Graph** introduces computational graphs that transform static workflows into intelligent, dynamic systems:

🔗 **Nodes** = Your AI functions and decision points  
🔄 **Edges** = Smart routing with conditions  
🎯 **State** = Persistent memory across executions  
⚡ **Streaming** = Real-time processing and events  

Perfect for:
- 🤖 AI Agents with reasoning capabilities
- 📊 Document processing pipelines  
- 🎯 Recommendation systems
- 🏗️ Microservice orchestration
