# 🎯 Smart Routing: Conditional Nodes That Make Decisions

What if your AI workflow could think on its feet? **Semantic Kernel Graph** conditional nodes make your applications truly intelligent!

🧠 **Dynamic Decisions** - Route based on content, not just rules
🔄 **Adaptive Workflows** - Change course based on results
🎯 **Context-Aware** - Make decisions using full state information
⚡ **Real-Time Logic** - Update routing as conditions change

```csharp
// Your workflow adapts intelligently
var conditionalGraph = new Graph
{
    StartNode = startNode,
    Nodes = new[] { startNode, decisionNode, routeA, routeB, endNode }
};

// Smart routing based on content
decisionNode.AddConditionalEdge(routeA, context => context.State.Score > 0.8);
decisionNode.AddConditionalEdge(routeB, context => context.State.Score <= 0.8);
```

Perfect for:
- 🎯 Content moderation systems
- 🏥 Medical diagnosis workflows
- 💳 Fraud detection pipelines
- 📊 Dynamic reporting systems
