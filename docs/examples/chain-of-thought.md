* Monitor and optimize reasoning performance

## Prerequisites

* **.NET 8.0** or later
* **OpenAI API Key** configured in `appsettings.json`
* **Semantic Kernel Graph package** installed
* Basic understanding of [Graph Concepts](../concepts/graph-concepts.md) and [Node Types](../concepts/node-types.md)

## Key Components

### Concepts and Techniques

* **Chain of Thought**: A reasoning pattern where the AI breaks down complex problems into sequential steps, showing its thinking process
* **Reasoning Validation**: Quality assessment of each reasoning step using confidence scoring and validation rules

* `ChainOfThoughtValidator`: Validates reasoning quality and confidence

## Running the Example

### Getting Started

This example demonstrates Chain-of-Thought reasoning patterns with the Semantic Kernel Graph package. The code snippets below show you how to implement this pattern in your own applications.

### Implementation Overview

The example below shows how to implement Chain-of-Thought reasoning in your own applications:

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Problem Solving with Chain-of-Thought

This example demonstrates basic problem-solving with step-by-step reasoning.

```csharp
// Create Chain-of-Thought node for problem solving
var cotNode = new ChainOfThoughtGraphNode(
    ChainOfThoughtType.ProblemSolving,
    maxSteps: 5,
    templateEngine: templateEngine,
    logger: logger)
{
    BacktrackingEnabled = true,
    MinimumStepConfidence = 0.6,
    CachingEnabled = true
};

// Create executor and add node
var executor = new GraphExecutor("ChainOfThought-ProblemSolving", 
    "Chain-of-Thought problem solving example", logger);
executor.AddNode(cotNode);
executor.SetStartNode(cotNode.NodeId);

// Prepare arguments
var arguments = new KernelArguments
{
    ["problem_statement"] = "A company needs to reduce operational costs by 20% while maintaining employee satisfaction...",
    ["context"] = "The company operates in a competitive tech market with high talent retention challenges.",
    ["constraints"] = "Cannot reduce headcount by more than 5%, must maintain current benefit levels...",
    ["expected_outcome"] = "A comprehensive cost reduction plan with specific actionable steps",
    ["reasoning_depth"] = 4
};

// Execute the graph
var result = await executor.ExecuteAsync(kernel, arguments, CancellationToken.None);
```

### 2. Analysis with Custom Templates

Demonstrates custom reasoning templates and validation rules.

```csharp
// Create custom template for business analysis
var analysisTemplate = new ChainOfThoughtTemplate
{
    Name = "BusinessAnalysis",
    Steps = new[]
    {
        "Identify the core business problem",
        "Analyze current state and constraints",
        "Generate potential solutions",
        "Evaluate solutions against criteria",
        "Recommend optimal approach"
    },
    ValidationRules = new[]
    {
        "Each step must reference specific data",
        "Solutions must be actionable",
        "Recommendations must include implementation steps"
    }
};

// Configure node with custom template
var analysisNode = new ChainOfThoughtGraphNode(
    ChainOfThoughtType.Analysis,
    maxSteps: 6,
    templateEngine: templateEngine,
    logger: logger)
{
    CustomTemplate = analysisTemplate,
    MinimumStepConfidence = 0.7,
    EnableStepValidation = true
};
```

### 3. Decision Making with Backtracking

Shows how to implement backtracking when reasoning fails.

```csharp
// Configure node with backtracking enabled
var decisionNode = new ChainOfThoughtGraphNode(
    ChainOfThoughtType.DecisionMaking,
    maxSteps: 4,
    templateEngine: templateEngine,
    logger: logger)
{
    BacktrackingEnabled = true,
    MaxBacktrackAttempts = 3,
    BacktrackStrategy = BacktrackStrategy.AlternativeApproach,
    MinimumStepConfidence = 0.8
};

// The node will automatically retry with different approaches
// when confidence falls below the threshold
```

### 4. Performance and Cache Demonstration

Optimizes reasoning performance with caching and metrics.

```csharp
// Enable performance monitoring
var performanceNode = new ChainOfThoughtGraphNode(
    ChainOfThoughtType.ProblemSolving,
    maxSteps: 5,
    templateEngine: templateEngine,
    logger: logger)
{
    CachingEnabled = true,
    CacheExpiration = TimeSpan.FromHours(24),
    EnablePerformanceMetrics = true,
    PerformanceThreshold = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)
};

// Monitor performance metrics
Console.WriteLine($"Node Statistics: {cotNode.Statistics.ExecutionCount} executions, " +
                $"{cotNode.Statistics.AverageQualityScore:P1} avg quality, " +
                $"{cotNode.Statistics.SuccessRate:P1} success rate");
```

## Configuration Options

### Chain of Thought Settings

```csharp
var cotOptions = new ChainOfThoughtOptions
{
    MaxSteps = 5,                           // Maximum reasoning steps
    MinimumStepConfidence = 0.6,            // Confidence threshold
    EnableBacktracking = true,              // Allow retry on failure
    MaxBacktrackAttempts = 3,               // Maximum retry attempts
    BacktrackStrategy = BacktrackStrategy.AlternativeApproach,
    CachingEnabled = true,                  // Cache successful reasoning
    CacheExpiration = TimeSpan.FromHours(24),
    EnableStepValidation = true,            // Validate each step
    PerformanceThreshold = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)
};
```

### Template Configuration

```csharp
var templateOptions = new ChainOfThoughtTemplateOptions
{
    DefaultTemplate = ChainOfThoughtType.ProblemSolving,
    CustomTemplates = new Dictionary<string, ChainOfThoughtTemplate>
    {
        ["BusinessAnalysis"] = businessAnalysisTemplate,
        ["TechnicalReview"] = technicalReviewTemplate,
        ["RiskAssessment"] = riskAssessmentTemplate
    },
    ValidationRules = new[]
    {
        "All steps must be logical and sequential",
        "Each step must build on previous steps",
        "Final answer must address the original problem"
    }
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Low Confidence Scores
```bash
# Problem: Steps consistently fail confidence validation
# Solution: Adjust confidence threshold or improve prompt quality
MinimumStepConfidence = 0.5; // Lower threshold for development
```

#### Excessive Backtracking
```bash
# Problem: Too many backtrack attempts
# Solution: Limit backtrack attempts or improve initial reasoning
MaxBacktrackAttempts = 2; // Reduce retry attempts
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Problem: Slow reasoning execution
# Solution: Enable caching and set performance thresholds
CachingEnabled = true;
PerformanceThreshold = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60);
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```csharp
// Enable debug logging
var logger = LoggerFactory.Create(builder =>
{
    builder.AddConsole();
    builder.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);
}).CreateLogger<ChainOfThoughtGraphNode>();

// Configure node with debug logging
var debugNode = new ChainOfThoughtGraphNode(
    ChainOfThoughtType.ProblemSolving,
    maxSteps: 5,
    templateEngine: templateEngine,
    logger: logger)
{
    EnableDebugMode = true,
    LogReasoningSteps = true,
    LogConfidenceScores = true
};
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Multi-Step Validation

```csharp
// Implement custom validation logic
var customValidator = new ChainOfThoughtValidator
{
    StepValidators = new[]
    {
        new StepValidator("LogicalFlow", step => ValidateLogicalFlow(step)),
        new StepValidator("DataReference", step => ValidateDataReference(step)),
        new StepValidator("Actionability", step => ValidateActionability(step))
    }
};

cotNode.Validator = customValidator;
```

### Dynamic Template Selection

```csharp
// Select template based on problem type
var templateSelector = new TemplateSelector
{
    Selector = (context) =>
    {
        var problemType = context.GetValue<string>("problem_type");
        return problemType switch
        {
            "business" => "BusinessAnalysis",
            "technical" => "TechnicalReview",
            "risk" => "RiskAssessment",
            _ => "ProblemSolving"
        };
    }
};

cotNode.TemplateSelector = templateSelector;
```
