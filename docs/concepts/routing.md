# Edges and routing

Routing determines the next node using conditional edges or dynamic strategies.

- Simple predicates over state
- Template-based evaluation with SK
- Advanced: semantic similarity, probabilistic routing, feedback learning

See `ConditionalEdge`, `DynamicRoutingEngine`, `RoutingStrategies`.
