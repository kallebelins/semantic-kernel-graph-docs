# Concepts overview

Core ideas you'll use across the library:

- Graphs: Directed graphs of nodes and conditional edges
- State: Typed wrapper around `KernelArguments` with versioning, validation
- Nodes: Function, Conditional, Loop, ErrorHandler, HumanApproval, Subgraph, etc.
- Execution: Sequential, parallel, distributed; checkpointing and recovery
- Streaming: Real-time events for UI and observability
- Visualization: DOT, Mermaid, JSON outputs for docs and tooling
