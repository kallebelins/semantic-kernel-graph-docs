# Glossary

This glossary defines the core terms and concepts used throughout the Semantic Kernel Graph documentation. Each term is defined in simple, accessible language while maintaining technical accuracy.

## Core Graph Concepts

**Graph**: A computational structure composed of nodes connected by edges that defines the flow of execution in a workflow. The graph orchestrates how data flows between different processing steps.

**Node**: A fundamental unit of computation in a graph that represents a single processing step. Each node can execute functions, make decisions, or perform specific operations.

**Edge**: A connection between two nodes that defines the path of execution flow. Edges can be conditional (only traversed when specific conditions are met) or unconditional (always traversed).

**Execution**: The process of running a graph by traversing nodes and edges according to the defined flow, processing data at each step.

**State**: The current data and context maintained throughout graph execution, including input arguments, intermediate results, and execution metadata.

## Node Types and Behavior

**FunctionGraphNode**: A node that encapsulates and executes a Semantic Kernel function, providing graph-aware behavior around existing ISKFunction instances.

**ActionGraphNode**: A specialized node that automatically discovers and executes appropriate tools or actions based on the current context and available functions.

**ConditionalGraphNode**: A node that makes routing decisions based on conditions, enabling dynamic workflow paths and branching logic.

**ReActLoopGraphNode**: A node that implements the Reasoning → Acting → Observing pattern for iterative problem-solving and decision-making.

**ObservationGraphNode**: A node that monitors and records execution results, providing visibility into workflow performance and outcomes.

## Edge and Routing Concepts

**ConditionalEdge**: A directional connection between nodes that includes a predicate function to determine whether the edge should be traversed during execution.

**Unconditional Edge**: An edge that is always traversed, providing a direct path between nodes without conditional logic.

**Routing**: The process of determining which node to execute next based on the current state and edge conditions.

**Dynamic Routing**: Advanced routing that makes decisions at runtime based on content analysis, similarity matching, or other contextual factors.

## State Management

**GraphState**: A typed wrapper for KernelArguments that serves as the foundation for graph execution, providing execution tracking and state manipulation capabilities.

**KernelArguments**: The underlying data container that holds input parameters, intermediate results, and execution context throughout the workflow.

**State Serialization**: The process of converting graph state to a persistent format for storage, transmission, or recovery purposes.

**State Validation**: The verification that state data meets required constraints and format requirements before processing.

## Execution and Control Flow

**GraphExecutor**: The main orchestrator for graph execution that manages the execution flow, navigation, and coordination of graph nodes.

**Execution Context**: The runtime environment that maintains execution state, metrics, and provides coordination services during graph execution.

**Execution Path**: The sequence of nodes visited during a graph run, representing the actual flow taken through the workflow.

**Execution Status**: The current state of a graph execution, such as NotStarted, Running, Paused, Completed, or Failed.

**Cancellation**: The ability to gracefully stop graph execution before completion, respecting cancellation tokens and cleanup procedures.

## Checkpointing and Recovery

**Checkpoint**: A saved snapshot of graph execution state at a specific point, enabling recovery and resumption of workflows.

**Checkpointing**: The process of creating, storing, and managing execution checkpoints for resilience and recovery purposes.

**Recovery**: The ability to restore graph execution from a previous checkpoint, continuing workflow processing from the saved state.

**State Persistence**: The long-term storage of graph state and checkpoints, typically using memory services or external storage systems.

**Checkpoint Validation**: The verification that saved checkpoints are complete, consistent, and can be successfully restored.

## Streaming and Real-time Execution

**Streaming Execution**: Real-time graph execution that provides immediate feedback and event streams as nodes complete processing.

**Event Stream**: A real-time sequence of execution events that provides visibility into graph processing as it happens.

**GraphExecutionEvent**: A structured notification about a specific occurrence during graph execution, such as node start, completion, or errors.

**Backpressure**: The mechanism for controlling the rate of event production to match consumer processing capabilities.

**Real-time Monitoring**: Live observation of graph execution progress, performance metrics, and status updates.

## Performance and Observability

**Metrics**: Quantitative measurements of graph execution performance, including timing, throughput, and resource utilization.

**Performance Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of execution metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimize workflow performance.

**Telemetry**: The collection and transmission of execution data for monitoring, debugging, and analysis purposes.

**Tracing**: Detailed tracking of execution flow through individual nodes and edges for debugging and performance analysis.

**Logging**: Structured recording of execution events, errors, and diagnostic information for operational visibility.

## Error Handling and Resilience

**Error Recovery**: The ability to detect, handle, and recover from execution failures while maintaining workflow integrity.

**Retry Policies**: Configurable strategies for automatically retrying failed operations with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns.

**Circuit Breaker**: A pattern that prevents repeated calls to failing services, allowing them time to recover before resuming operations.

**Fallback Strategies**: Alternative execution paths or default behaviors when primary operations fail or are unavailable.

**Error Propagation**: The mechanism by which errors are communicated through the graph execution chain for appropriate handling.

## Advanced Patterns

**Multi-Agent Coordination**: The orchestration of multiple specialized agents working together to solve complex problems.

**Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Integration of human decision-making and approval steps within automated workflows.

**Parallel Execution**: Simultaneous processing of multiple nodes or workflow branches to improve performance and throughput.

**Fork-Join Patterns**: Workflow structures that split execution into parallel paths and then recombine results.

**Template Engine**: A system for creating reusable workflow patterns and configurations that can be customized for specific use cases.

## Integration and Extensions

**Plugin System**: A mechanism for dynamically loading and integrating external functionality into graph workflows.

**REST Tools**: Integration capabilities for calling external APIs and services from within graph nodes.

**Memory Integration**: Connection to persistent storage systems for maintaining context across multiple workflow executions.

**Custom Extensions**: User-defined functionality that extends the core graph capabilities with domain-specific logic.

**API Integration**: Methods for exposing graph workflows as REST endpoints or other external interfaces.

## Development and Testing

**Debug Mode**: Enhanced execution mode that provides detailed logging, breakpoints, and inspection capabilities for development.

**Graph Inspection**: Tools and APIs for examining graph structure, state, and execution history during development and debugging.

**Unit Testing**: Testing individual nodes and edges in isolation to verify correct behavior and edge cases.

**Integration Testing**: Testing complete graph workflows to ensure proper coordination and end-to-end functionality.

**Performance Testing**: Evaluating graph execution performance under various load conditions and data volumes.

## Configuration and Options

**Graph Options**: Configurable parameters that control graph behavior, performance, and feature availability.

**Execution Options**: Settings that govern how graphs are executed, including timeouts, concurrency limits, and resource constraints.

**Checkpoint Options**: Configuration for checkpoint creation, storage, compression, and retention policies.
