# ðŸ’¬ Build a Smart Chatbot with Memory in Minutes

Remember when chatbots were just simple rule-based responders? Those days are over! 

**Semantic Kernel Graph** lets you build intelligent chatbots that:
ðŸ§  **Remember conversations** across sessions
ðŸ”„ **Learn from interactions** to improve responses
ðŸŽ¯ **Route conversations** based on context
âš¡ **Stream responses** in real-time

```csharp
// Your chatbot becomes a computational graph
var chatGraph = new Graph
{
    StartNode = conversationNode,
    Nodes = new[] { conversationNode, memoryNode, responseNode }
};
```

Perfect for customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.
