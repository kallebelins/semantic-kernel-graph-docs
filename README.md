# Semantic Kernel Graph Package

A powerful and extensible graph-based execution framework built on top of Microsoft's Semantic Kernel, designed for building sophisticated AI workflows, multi-agent systems, and intelligent applications.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Capabilities
* **Graph-Based Execution**: Define complex AI workflows as directed graphs with nodes and edges
* **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestrate multiple AI agents with shared state and communication
* **Dynamic Routing**: Intelligent routing based on content, confidence scores, and business logic
* **Checkpointing & Recovery**: Resume execution from any point with full state preservation
* **Streaming Execution**: Real-time event streaming for interactive applications
* **Human-in-the-Loop**: Built-in support for human approval and intervention workflows

### Advanced Patterns
* **Chain of Thought**: Structured reasoning with validation and confidence scoring
* **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)**: Iterative problem-solving with tool usage
* **Multi-Hop RAG**: Advanced retrieval-augmented generation with retry mechanisms
* **Conditional Execution**: Dynamic workflow branching based on AI decisions
* **Parallel Processing**: Fork-join patterns for concurrent task execution

### Enterprise Features
* **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and observability
* **Error Recovery**: Intelligent error handling with automatic retry strategies
* **Resource Governance**: Cost controls, rate limiting, and circuit breakers
* **Security & Auth**: Enterprise-grade authentication and authorization
* **Visualization**: Real-time graph execution visualization and debugging tools

## 🏗️ Architecture

The framework is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and enables extensibility:

* **Core**: Graph execution engine, state management, and fundamental patterns
* **Nodes**: Reusable workflow components (actions, conditionals, loops, etc.)
* **Extensions**: Framework extensions for advanced use cases
* **Integration**: Templates, policies, and enterprise integrations
* **Streaming**: Real-time event processing and communication

## 🔧 Usage

### Basic Graph Definition
```csharp
var graph = new GraphBuilder()
    .AddNode("start", new ActionNode("Initialize workflow"))
    .AddNode("process", new ActionNode("Process data"))
    .AddNode("decision", new ConditionalNode("Make decision"))
    .AddNode("complete", new ActionNode("Complete workflow"))
    
    .AddEdge("start", "process")
    .AddEdge("process", "decision")
    .AddEdge("decision", "complete", "success")
    
    .Build();

var executor = new GraphExecutor();
var result = await executor.ExecuteAsync(graph, context);
```

### Advanced Multi-Agent Workflow
```csharp
var workflow = new MultiAgentWorkflowBuilder()
    .AddAgent("researcher", new ResearchAgent())
    .AddAgent("analyst", new AnalysisAgent())
    .AddAgent("writer", new WritingAgent())
    
    .DefineWorkflow(workflow => workflow
        .StartWith("researcher")
        .Then("analyst")
        .Then("writer")
        .WithHumanApproval("final_review")
    )
    
    .Build();
```
